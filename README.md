Clockwise
=====

A configurable test host for embedded operating systems.
Clockwise is developed with the goal of making the [Tock](https://github.com/tock/tock) embedded OS testable.
Even so, the software's capabilities extend to making it possible to test any embedded platform.

One of Clockwise's goals is to make embedded systems testing approachable at a low cost.
This being the case, Clockwise runs on the Raspberry Pi platform.
